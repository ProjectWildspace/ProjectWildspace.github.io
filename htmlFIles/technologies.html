						<legend>Qt Creator and PySide6</legend>
						<p class="mainText">
						The driving force behind our intuitive Graphical-User-Interface was the Qt Creator software. Working with Qt was a struggle, and composing the AI generative engine objects in Python was a challenge, but the end result was a beautiful, intuitive, and responsive GUI that we are proud of. One of our members had previous experience working with Qt in C++ which provided some insight, but as a team, this software was entirely new to us and an engaging learning experience during the hackathon.

						<legend>LangChain</legend>
						<p class="mainText">
						Powering our unique generation and Wildspace Traversal was the Langchain AI Module. By leveraging output parsers and prompt engineering, we were able to bind the OpenAI API to act as we pleased. And by creating prompt templates, we were able to accomplish our main goal of injecting world context into worldbuilding generation. After testing many NPCs, Buildings, Towns, Groups, and Encounters, we are very pleased with the presence and ambience the contextualized worlds have on output generation.
